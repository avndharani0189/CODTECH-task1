OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT :
project : advanced calculator.
    This Java project is an Advanced Calculator that performs basic arithmetic and advanced operations, while also keeping a history of calculations. Hereâ€™s an overview of its functionality:

**Key Features:
 
 *User Input:
The program prompts the user to input two numbers.
It then offers a menu of available operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulus, exponentiation, or exit).
The user selects an operation by entering a corresponding number.
 
 *Operations Supported:
Addition (+): Adds the two numbers.
Subtraction (-): Subtracts the second number from the first.
Multiplication (*): Multiplies the two numbers.
Division (/): Divides the first number by the second, with a check to avoid division by zero.
Modulus (%): Calculates the remainder when the first number is divided by the second.
Exponentiation (^): Raises the first number to the power of the second.
Exit: Ends the program.
 
 *Error Handling:
The program uses a try-catch block to handle invalid input (non-numeric values) and prompts the user to enter valid numeric values.

 *History Tracking:
The program maintains an ArrayList<String> that stores the history of all performed operations.
After each operation, the result is displayed along with the current calculation, and the operation is logged in the history.
 
 *Looping:
The program runs in a while loop, continuously prompting the user for input and performing calculations until the user selects the option to exit.

 *Exit Mechanism:
If the user selects the "Exit" option (choice 7), the loop ends, the program thanks the user, and the program terminates.
